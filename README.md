# QRfinal
Scanning and posting the QR String to the AttendanceTrackingSystem

This code will execute the QR-Code-Scanning Process on the Raspberry Pi. With the connected webcam, the Pi will scan the qr code for attendance to the tutorials and will note whether the Student has presented an excercise.

Step 1:

PiFace and the console will give the option to select whether a qr-code should be scanned (which means, the student is present) or he is not present.

Step 2:

For the case a student is in attendance, the next option is whether the student will present an excercise or not.
