Scanning and posting the QR String to the AttendanceTrackingSystem

How it works:

When the raspi is connected to a webcam, and a QR Code from the Android App is given, the Raspi will scan the QR Code and will convert it to the String. The QR Code will be posted to the Web-Service, which means that a Student is "saved" as Attendant, and in case he has to present something, it will be asked, whether he will present something or not. This will also be send to the Web-Service.
