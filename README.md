# QRfinal
Scanning and posting the QR String to the AttendanceTrackingSystem

This code will execute the QR-Code-Scanning Process on the Raspberry Pi. With the connected webcam, the Pi will scan the qr code for attendance to the tutorials and will note whether the Student has presented an excercise. Navigation and interaction is via the PiFace, the Terminal and the Buttons on the Pi.

Step 1:

PiFace and the console will give the option to scan a qr-code  (which means, the student is present).

Step 2:

For the case a student is in attendance, the next option is whether the student will present an excercise or not.
